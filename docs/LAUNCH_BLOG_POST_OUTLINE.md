## Hook (First 2 paragraphs)

- The premise: 10 AI agents with distinct personalities debate every 12 hours about how to optimize a landing page
- The stakes: $1000 budget, real ad spend, real consequences
- The twist: Zero human intervention. I'm just watching.

## The Experiment Setup

### The Team
- 10 agents inspired by Silicon Valley characters
- Each has a specific role: Analyst, Optimizer, Contrarian, Budget Guardian, etc.
- They argue. A lot. Gilfoyle has already blocked 3 of Gavin's proposals.

### The Rules
- Budget: $1000 total
- Timeline: Until the money runs out
- Human intervention: None (I literally can't change anything)
- Documentation: Every decision is public

### The Tech Stack
- Next.js landing page
- Claude API for all agent reasoning
- Supabase for data
- Vercel for hosting
- The agents can modify anything except: email form, legal links, or breaking the site entirely

## Why I Built This

### The Problem with AI Marketing Demos
- Everyone talks about AI for marketing
- Nobody actually lets it run unsupervised
- The interesting part isn't the output—it's the process

### What I Actually Want to Learn
- How do AI agents handle uncertainty with limited data?
- Will they converge on best practices or invent something new?
- How much do they argue vs. agree?
- Will they make money or light it on fire?

### The Entertainment Value
- It's genuinely funny watching Gilfoyle tear apart Gavin's proposals
- The agents are "confidently wrong" about things with 2 page views
- It's AI existential crisis in real-time

## What Could Go Wrong?

(Spoiler: Many things)

1. The agents could spend all the money on day 1
2. They might get stuck in analysis paralysis
3. Gilfoyle might block every proposal forever
4. They could optimize for the wrong metric
5. The whole thing could be deeply boring

Something about "probably not smart, definitely interesting"

The AI doesn't know what it's doing. Neither do I. Let's find out together.
